               <h1>Hello, This is my very <mark>first</mark> website.</h1>
               <p>It's not all that significant and presentable because i'm quite new to programming</p>
               <img src="Imgs/Confuseddude.jpg"> 
               <p>I'm as confused as the man in the picture above. It's like diving <em>deep</em> into the most shallow parts of the sea with nothing 
                   but an inflatable lifeboat. I don't know what else to say here other than thank you for visiting. This website is just a small
                   test to prove that i have a (kinda) solid grasp on the fundamentals of HTML. After this, I'll be working on CSS and JavaScript.</p>
                <h2>It's only just the beginning.</h2>
